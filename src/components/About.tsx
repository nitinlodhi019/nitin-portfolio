          Hi, I'm <strong>Nitin</strong> — "I am an aspiring Data Scientist with
          practical experience in machine learning, deep learning, and data
          analytics. I enjoy working with Python and SQL, especially when
          building predictive models and creating meaningful data
          visualizations. Right now, I’m diving deeper into deep learning and
          learning how to use Power BI for building interactive dashboards and
          reports."
